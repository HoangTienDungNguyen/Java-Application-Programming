-------BattleShip-------


The BattleShip game is a strategic naval combat game designed with a robust and modular architecture following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. It provides an engaging player experience through strategic gameplay, interactive interfaces, and AI-driven opponents.

Overview:
Game Objective: Players strategically place ships on a grid and attempt to locate and   destroy the opponent's fleet before their own ships are sunk.
      
Core Features:

          Interactive Gameplay: Players interact with a grid-based system for ship placement and attacks.
          
          AI Opponents: Includes both basic and advanced AI strategies (SimpleRandomAI and SmarterAI) for dynamic gameplay.
          
          Enhanced Visuals: Updated background visuals and the addition of a splash screen improve the game's aesthetic appeal.
          
          Simplified Menu System: Provides easy navigation with options to change language, adjust game settings, and exit.

Architecture:
The game is divided into three primary components:

          Model: Handles game logic, data, and rules (e.g., Game, Position, Ship).
          
          View: Manages user interfaces, including the main game panel, menus, and status displays.
          
          Controller: Oversees the interaction between the user and the game logic, including AI behavior.
